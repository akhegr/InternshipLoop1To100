# InternshipLoop1To100
This project is made in relation to my internship on my education as computer scientist.
The console application is able to loop all numbers between 1 and 100.

If the number is divisible by 3, the app will return Aksel.
If the number is divisible by 5, the app will return Gregersen.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the app will return Aksel Gregersen.
Otherwise, it will return the number.
