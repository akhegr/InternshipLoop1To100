# InternshipLoop1To100
This project is made in relation to my internship on my education as computer scientist.
<br>The console application is able to loop all numbers between 1 and 100.
<br><br>If the number is divisible by 3, the app will return Aksel.
<br>If the number is divisible by 5, the app will return Gregersen.
<br>If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the app will return Aksel Gregersen.
<br>Otherwise, it will return the number.
